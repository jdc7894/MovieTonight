Heroku url: movie-tonight.herokuapp.com/index
(Important: If you put http:// in front of this url, it will lead to a site that does not work (It seems like a page with earlier commits in my github). I don't know why but it works with the link without http:// in front. Please let me know if you have any ideas why this is hapenning!)
